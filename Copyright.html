        DumbAloo has been owned and operated by online publisher Chitra Jain and Aryan Kothari, India since November 2022. Previous to that, they built an page on Instgram where they published realted content. We are available on Google, Facebook, YouTube, and a host of other social media and news platforms. That said, nothing influence or otherwise dictate the opinions of the editorial teams nor interfere with site objectives, voice, or topic selection.
        <br><br>

Programatic advertising platforms fund the majority of website operations, editorial salaries, and content payouts; still, the DumbAloo editorial staff, writers, and content team operate independent. The two do not interact nor influence each otherâ€™s work. Representation of all viewpoints, perspectives, and writers of all backgrounds are strongly encouraged by the senior editors - ensuring that objectivity and accuracy of our content is never restricted by any one writer, editor, partner, or business devision.
<br><br>
Note: While we strive to provide readers with a great ad experience, advertisements may not necessarily reflect the views of DumbAloo.
<br><br>
On rare occasions, partnerships, direct sales campaigns, and sponsorships are negotiated by our ads team or content teams. Sponsored articles are clearly identified with a disclosure statement identifying the post accordingly. Similarly, select articles also include affiliate links for which Valnet receives a commission on purchased items. Articles that include affiliate links also contain a statement disclosing an affiliate partnership. 
<br><br>
The DumbAloo editorial team leverages relationships with studios, networks, and other partners for the purpose of exclusive interviews, review product, and other opportunities that help us create informed and accurate content. We are not paid for this content. To ensure that access does not influence editorial objectivity, we abide by a thorough ethics policy that all writers, editors, and contributors must follow. Read our complete ethics policy for full details.
