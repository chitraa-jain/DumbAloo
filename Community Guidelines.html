        Violations of community guidelines are inevitable. Being clear about consequences is just as important as clearly stating the rules. Include a section that lists the actions taken in the event of a transgression. Keep it fair and uncomplicated and provide explanations for actions taken by moderators. Some information you should include is: <br>
        
        What is the penalty for first time, second time, third time offenders? <br> <br>
        How many violations are allowed before suspension/ban? <br> <br>
        Will posts that go against community guidelines be deleted? <br> <br>
        Does your organization have a zero-tolerance policy for certain behavior? <br><br>
        As mentioned earlier, don’t be too quick to dish out punishment. There are better ways of dealing with guideline violations, whether they’re on purpose or by mistake. For example, you can guide the discourse of your online community. Offer up conversation prompts or industry news. This shows that you’re genuinely interested in community engagement and keep the conversation positive. <br><br>
        
        It’s also crucial that your moderation team is consistent in what they remove and their reasoning for doing so. Preferential treatment or inconsistency will raise alarm and perhaps even invite an increase in bad behavior. <br><br>
